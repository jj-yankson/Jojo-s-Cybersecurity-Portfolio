**Professional Statement**

If you are reading this, then it means you came across my portfolio, hope you find my journey inspiring. 
My name is Jefferson Joojo Yankson, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Ghana, with a major in Computer Security.
I am driven towards Safeguarding Systems And Networks.

In information technology i see a purposeful and versatile vocation yet cybersecurity is what i love most. Last year, I read about recent digital attacks and how they've impacted 
the digital world. I came across the equifax breach. Due to the lack of secured systems, Personally Identifiable Information known as PII and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information known as SPII were leaked. 

.........
These are the core skills I have acquired so far, and I will keep updating this list as I progress.
