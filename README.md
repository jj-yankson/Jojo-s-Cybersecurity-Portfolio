**Professional Statement**

If you are reading this, then it means you came across my portfolio, hope you find my journey inspiring. 
My name is Jefferson Joojo Yankson, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Ghana, with a major in Computer Security.
I am driven towards Safeguarding Systems And Networks.

I thrive on excellent time management, sharp problem-solving abilities, and a strong foundation in programming.
These strengths have become an integral part of who I am, shaping the way I approach challenges and opportunities alike. 
I have developed them into habits by prioritizing tasks and planning my days effectively, which allows me to manage projects in an organized and factual manner.

I am currently on a journey to become a cybersecurity engineer. 
I’m taking Google’s cybersecurity course because I believe it will provide me with a solid understanding of core cybersecurity concepts. 
This course will also prepare me to pursue the Cisco CyberOps, CompTIA Networking+, and CompTIA security+ certifications. When the journey gets a bit rough, I will refuel my energy.

So far, I have completed 2 out of 8 modules in Google’s cybersecurity course. My certificates can be found in my education folder.

These are the core skills I have acquired so far, and I will keep updating this list as I progress.
