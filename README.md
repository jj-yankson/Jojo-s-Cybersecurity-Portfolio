**Professional Statement**

My name is Jefferson Joojo Yankson, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Ghana, with a major in Computer Security. I am passionate about protecting individuals and data by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to authorized users while adhering to compliance and regulatory laws.

My core strengths are time management, problem-solving skills, and programming.

These strengths have become second nature to me. I have developed them into habits by prioritizing tasks and planning my days effectively, which allows me to manage projects in an organized and factual manner.

I also enjoy using my critical thinking skills to solve problems. Finding innovative solutions is something I am passionate about, and it is particularly crucial in cybersecurity, where the fast identification and mitigation of threats is essential.

Additionally, I appreciate the art of programming, as it streamlines workflows and minimizes human errors. I utilize Python to automate tasks and SQL to create, interact with, and query data points in a database.

I am also passionate about adhering to ethics and compliance. Integrity is a key value in cybersecurity; I firmly believe in doing what is right, even when it is challenging, and upholding ethical standards.

Furthermore, I value collaboration and promoting integrity among team members. I believe that working together with professionals from diverse backgrounds is essential in addressing evolving threats and mitigating risks and data breaches. My goal is to ensure integrity within any team I work with by fostering transparency among team members.
