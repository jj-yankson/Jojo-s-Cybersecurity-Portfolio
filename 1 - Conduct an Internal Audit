# Controls And Compliance Assessment.
### Case Study. 
This is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as its main office, storefront, and warehouse for its products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, its information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support its online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The audit's goal is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, an internal audit will be performed by completing a controls and compliance checklist.


##Scenario
Botium Toys: Scope, goals, and risk assessment report.

### Establishing The Scope of the Audit;
Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. The audit will cover the entire security program at Botium Toys. This refers to individuals, assets, policies, and procedures that may affect the security posture of Botium Toys. 

### Goals
. Ensuring business continuity by adhering to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for EU citizens and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 
. Identifying and diminishing threats, risks, and vulnerabilities by implementing appropriate security controls. 

## Current assets.

Assets managed by the IT Department include:

● On-premises equipment for in-office business needs

● Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc.
● Storefront products available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the
company’s adjoining warehouse
● Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management
● Internet access
● Internal network
● Data retention and storage
● Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring


## Risk Assessments.

### Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 
Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.
Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
Encryption is not currently used to ensure the confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database. 
Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. 
The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data. 
The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees, to properly document and maintain data.
Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters, and at least one number; special characters). 
There is no centralized password management system that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks, and intervention methods are unclear.
The store’s physical location, which includes Botium Toys’ main offices, storefront, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.

## Control categories
Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:
● Administrative/Managerial controls (address the human component of cybersecurity.)
● Technical controls(consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems
(IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc.)
● Physical/Operational controls( They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by
unauthorized personnel).

## Control types
Control types include, but are not limited to:
1. Preventative
2. Corrective
3. Detective
4. Deterrent

These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets.
Preventative controls are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the
first place. Corrective controls are used to restore an asset after an incident. Detective
controls are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in
progress. Deterrent controls are designed to discourage attacks.

## Recommendations:  
Several controls need to be implemented to ensure the confidentiality of customers' data SPII/PII, these principles could include
1. Encryption to ensure that data is only accessible to authorized users. 
2. Principle of least privilege, employees are strictly provided with the exact resources they need to perform a task.
3. Separation of duties to prevent employees from having multiple privileges in the organization.
4. IDS to alert any malicious behavior. 
5. Password policies to outline guides for a robust password.
6. Password management systems to store passwords in case of any password issues.
7. Backups to ensure business continuity in case of any breach
8. Daily maintenance of legacy systems to receive regular updates and patches to prevent them from being vulnerable.
9. These practices will improve the security posture of the organization.
